<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>The Trial is a wonderful yet depressing book by Franz Kafka which explores the
human condition while telling the story about a mysterious trial endured by a
certain Mr Joseph K who works as a Chief Clerk in a bank.</p>
<p>One day, Mr K is surprised to find Police in his home, who are there to arrest
him for a crime which they can't reveal - because it's secret. Now, he is faced
with the daunting task of preparing his defence, without knowing any details
about the accusations, or hearing any arguments from the prosecution. Secret
courts, shabby courtrooms located in attics, strange lawyers and even stranger
laws all contribute to the madness that Mr K has to deal with.</p>
<p>The book plays on the theme of the Condemned Man -  similar to other
existentialist literature like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky and The
Outsider by Albert Camus, but is much more enjoyable because of the bizarre,
crazy and sadistic bureaucracy involved in the courtroom. Subtle allegories
point toward the similarities between the human condition and Mr K's plight.</p>
<p>4/5 - a pleasure to read.</p>

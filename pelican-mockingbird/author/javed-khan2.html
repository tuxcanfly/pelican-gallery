<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>Quote:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?”
― Garth Nix, Sabriel
</pre>
<p>Sabriel is the first book of the Old Kingdom aka the Abhorsen trilogy.  It's a
story about the coming-of-age of a young girl named Sabriel (surprise!).  The
plot is set somewhere in England in a place where the normal and the magical
worlds are divided by the Wall. Sabriel and other members of her family are the
Abhorsens or necromancers who are tasked with keeping the dead actually
dead and not letting them wander out into our living world. Death is the main theme
of the book and is described as another universe where dead souls float away in
a river and cross the various gates. Sabriel's adventure begins when she finds
out that her father has been trapped in one of these gates by the evil
Kerrigor. There are some touching father-daughter moments concerning death.</p>
<p>The narrative is gripping and keeps your attention, but the plot is unoriginal
and a bit too melodramatic. Hardcore fantasy fans might also be disappointed by
the lack of details and history of the magical elements.</p>
<p>Somewhat off topic, but the cover-art alone is worth buying this book! The
calm, yet determined expression of Sabriel, with her dark hair melting into the
dark realm of Death, it quite perfectly captures the essence of the story.</p>
<p>3.5/5 - Overall a good read with some memorable if stereotyped characters.</p>

<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>The Metamorphosis (Die Verwandlung) is a novella by Franz Kafka which tells a
bizarre story with a rather mundane conclusion. It's surreal premise and
claustrophobic environment keeps the reader guessing throughout.</p>
<p>The story is set in an early 20th century Germany city and takes place in the
household of the Mr and Mrs. Samsa who live with their son and daughter -
Gregory and Grete.  Gregory is a hard-working salesman who supports his family,
while the rest of the family members are dependent on him. So far, so good. Now
one fine day, Gregory turns into a weird human-sized bug and what follows is
the turn of events that occur in their household and how Gregory copes with his
newfound cockroach-like body. Doesn't make sense? Well.. too bad for you.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Gregory, the cockroach, is incapable of supporting the family,
it's up to his parents and his sister to provide for themselves and also take
care of him. At the end of the story, the sister is shown to have matured and
the parents also seem to have regained their health. I guess the question is -
what was the metamorphosis and what changed?</p>
<p>Warning! - The answer might trigger an existential crisis.</p>
<p>4/5 - would read again</p>

<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>The Trial is a wonderful yet depressing book by Franz Kafka which explores the
human condition while telling the story about a mysterious trial endured by a
certain Mr Joseph K who works as a Chief Clerk in a bank.</p>
<p>One day, Mr K is surprised to find Police in his home, who are there to arrest
him for a crime which they can't reveal - because it's secret. Now, he is faced
with the daunting task of preparing his defence, without knowing any details
about the accusations, or hearing any arguments from the prosecution. Secret
courts, shabby courtrooms located in attics, strange lawyers and even stranger
laws all contribute to the madness that Mr K has to deal with.</p>
<p>The book plays on the theme of the Condemned Man -  similar to other
existentialist literature like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky and The
Outsider by Albert Camus, but is much more enjoyable because of the bizarre,
crazy and sadistic bureaucracy involved in the courtroom. Subtle allegories
point toward the similarities between the human condition and Mr K's plight.</p>
<p>4/5 - a pleasure to read.</p>

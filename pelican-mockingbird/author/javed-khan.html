All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face
- forever.

-- George Orwell
</pre>
<p>Animal Farm is a short book by George Orwell but don't let it's small size and
cheerful title fool you because this is not a fairy tale. It's a cautionary
warning to all future generations about human nature - greed, narcissism, power
and corruption. Orwell had a unique insight into the psychology of various
sections of the society with relationship to their leaders and brilliantly
portrays them as different animals in the farm. If you haven't already, do
yourself a favor and read this book. It won't take more than a day to finish
it.</p>
<p>The story starts off with a rebellion by all animals united against a common
enemy: Mr Jones, the farm owner. Two pigs - Snowball and Napoleon hatch a plan
and together with the support of horses, dogs, geese and all animals, are
successful in driving the farmer out. Rejoicing at the revolution, they set out
to re-create their society and write their own version of the sacred
commandments. The pigs being the most intelligent animals and the only
literate ones, are the authors of most of these laws. They soon realize their
privileged status and thus begin to hijack the revolution. Snowball wants to
create a windmill but is driven out because Napoleon has other plans and is
able to convince the animals the Snowball is actually a spy. Now Napoleon takes
over and the rest of the story details how greed and corruption turn him into
the very thing that all animals had revolted against - human.</p>
<p>The metaphorical relation between different animals and different sections of
the public is very beautiful: pigs - intelligentsia, dogs - loyalists, sheep -
masses, horses - hard workers, raven - religious, donkey - old and wise. The
transformation of the pigs from revolutionaries to brutal dictators is also
worth noticing. It indicates that power corrupts everyone, however clean they
may appear today. Orwell also points out the distinct features of
Authoritarianism as it gradually begins to form - guilt-based witch-hunts, no
fair trials, brutal punishments, lies and propaganda, fear-mongering (Jones
will come back!, Snowball destroyed the windmill!), silently re-writing laws,
mind-numbing praises (Dear Leader, Comrade Napoleon), chants (Four legs good,
two legs bad!), songs, slogans, rituals; and suppression of thought.
Anti-authoritarian also means anti-religious since God is the ultimate
authority and the parallels between the farm under Napoleon and a Church or
Mosque are as plain as daylight.</p>
<p>5/5 - Small and delightfully thought-provoking. Must-read.</p>

<p>To start off, you'll need to install the following additional packages:</p>

<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preferences">
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>Checkout the Preferences options. I prefer the Flat-file configuration backend
as I want to keep all my compiz configuration in a single file and version
control it.</p>
<p>Make sure you create a backup of your current config using the Export option
before you start.</p>

<p class="caption">I've mapped &lt;Super&gt;Return to my terminal (urxvt) and

<p>The Commands plugin gives you a simple way to assign keyboard shortcuts to any
command.</p>
<p>Figure out your most used commands/apps and assign shortcuts to them. No more
wading your way through menus and searching for apps. Some commands I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>urxvt -&gt; &lt;Super&gt;Return
gvim -&gt; &lt;Super&gt;e
chromium-browser --incognito -&gt; &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Super&gt;w

<h2>General</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../static/images/general.gif"><img alt="Showcasing general key bindings" class="align-center" src="../static/images/general.gif" /></a>
<p>I find the key-bindings in this section very useful. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Close Window -&gt; &lt;Super&gt;q
Toggle Window Maximizes -&gt; &lt;Super&gt;m
</pre></div>
<p>Combined with Commands plugin above, this configuration allows you to spawn,
close and maximize/restore your windows all with key-bindings!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extra-wm-actions">
<h2>Extra WM Actions</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../static/images/extra.gif"><img alt="Showcasing extra wm actions" class="align-center" src="../static/images/extra.gif" /></a>
<p>Ever wanted to turn a window fullscreen but couldn't because the app doesn't
allow it?  Want to keep a window on top?</p>
<p>Extra WM actions provides key-bindings for these features. The mapping I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Toggle Fullscreen -&gt; &lt;Supfer&gt;f
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grid">
<h2>Grid</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../static/images/grid.gif"><img alt="Showcasing grid plugin" class="align-center" src="../static/images/grid.gif" /></a>
<p>Grid provides a window tiling feature with intuitive key-bindings. It's great
for people coming from a tiling window manager (like me).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="desktop-wall-cube">
<h2>Desktop Wall/Cube</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../static/images/desktops.gif"><img alt="Showcasing desktop wall" class="align-center" src="../static/images/desktops.gif" /></a>
<p>Both plugins provide an intuitive UI for multiple workspaces and are very
helpful for multitasking.</p>
<p>I map the Move Left/Right to keys on the home row:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Move Left -&gt; &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Control&gt;&lt;Primary&gt;&lt;Super&gt;j
Move Right -&gt; &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Control&gt;&lt;Primary&gt;&lt;Super&gt;k
</pre></div>

-- Chapter 37 The Botanic Garden, Amber Spyglass
</pre>
<p>It's been about a week since I've finished the last chapter of the series, and
I'm still absolutely floored at what a magnificent journey it has been and
still reeling from the emotional roller-coaster that the last chapters have
been. The series starts of with so many open mysteries and ends them all with
such grace that you can only wonder at it in awe. I'm glad that such a series
exists, that I came to know about it and had the extremely grateful opportunity
to read and enjoy it. I'm a mere mortal and I'm sure I can't do this series
justice by reviewing it, but I shall dare to try anyway.</p>
<p>His Dark Materials is an epic fantasy trilogy consisting of three books:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Northern Lights</li>
<li>The Subtle Knife</li>
<li>The Amber Spyglass</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="the-northern-lights">
<h3>The Northern Lights:</h3>
<p>The story is set in a parallel universe not unlike ours (although in the
beginning of the modern age), but with Dust, dæmons, the Alethiometer, witches,
angels and armoured bears. Lyra and her dæmon, Pantalaimon are off to a great
adventure to the North with the Gyptians where they'll need to rescue children
who have been kidnapped by the Gobblers. On her journey, Lyra encounters the
witches and armoured bears, seeking their help in her task. With courage,
cunning and the help of Iorek Byrnison the armoured bear, she takes on the evil
Gobblers. Towards the end, she has to choose between staying back or following
her father into another universe to seek closure for a friend she betrays
accidentally.</p>
<p>The action, adventure and mystery in this book make for a gripping narrative
will keep the reader hooked to solve the puzzle. A brief chat between the witch
Serafina Pekkala and the aeronaut Lee Scoresby contrasts the politics of both
sides. The exchange of words between Lyra and her father towards the end throws
light on the book's philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-subtle-knife">
<h3>The Subtle Knife:</h3>
<p>Finding herself in a strange new world (Cittàgazze), Lyra wanders and finds
another visitor, Will (from our current universe) and thus begins another
adventure to find Will's father, John Parry who is believed to have travelled
across to another universe. They enter Will's universe and find themselves in
trouble because the Alethiometer gets stolen by one of the members of the
Church and they have to find a certain &quot;Subtle Knife&quot; to get their Alethiometer
back. After a long fight with Knife's owner in Cittàgazze, they manage to get
hold of it and soon discover it's magic - it's a knife that can cut through the
very fabric of time and space to create a portal into another Universe! So, the
children use it and get back their stolen stuff with a clever plan. Lyra also
makes a new friend called Dr Mary Malone whose research into Dark Matter turns
out be similar to Dust. Meanwhile, Lyra's old friend Mr. Scoresby is assisting
Will's father find the children. Unfortunately, also looking for Will and Lyra
is a unit of the Church, headed by Mrs Coulter.</p>
<p>The second book introduces elements of science-fiction and builds on the
growing tension between the freethinkers headed by Lord Asriel and the Church.
There are a few heartbreaking moments when Lee Scoresby defends against the
Church's army and John Parry meets his son, Will.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-amber-spyglass">
<h3>The Amber Spyglass:</h3>
<p>We find that Mrs Coulter has kidnapped Lyra and many groups are looking for her
including Will and the armoured bears whom he befriends, Lord Asriel's army and
the Church's army. As is expected, there's a showdown between the three forces,
and the children manage to escape to another universe, Mrs Coulter is captured
by Lord Asriel's army. Meanwhile, Dr Mary Malone crosses into a strange
universe with small elephant-like creatures using wheels in addition to their
limbs. As the children go looking for the world of the dead, we find that the
Church has dispatched a hitman to kill Lyra to prevent a prophecy which would
end the Church's power. Mrs Coulter escapes to the Church, spies on them and
learns of another plan to assasinate Lyra. With the introduction of Metatron,
the Authority's commander, the fate of the battle between Lord Asriel and all
of the Church looms in the balance.</p>
<p>After an epic battle, we find the children with Dr Mary Malone who tempts them
into falling in love by telling them her story. What follows is an absolutely
amazing sequence recreating the traditional Adam and Eve story - the
temptation, the fall, the realization and acceptance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>There are lot of fantasy books and lots of beautiful poems, but in my opinion
none can match the breathtaking mix of fantasy and poetry that is His Dark
Materials. Yes, there are a few loose threads, but I think they are far too
minor to worry about. To crave for a 'happy lived together ever after' ending
is to miss the point of the book - there's no Paradise after all! If you want
one, create it yourself!</p>

<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>Quote:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Yeah, but if you look at it like that we're all pretty much empty, don't
you think?  You eat, take a dump, do your crummy job for your lousy pay,
and get laid occasionally, if you're lucky. What else is there?

― Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the shore
</pre>
<p>This is my first Murakami book and I didn't know what to expect. Boy, was I in
for a treat. Kafka's bizzare universe seems to have been waiting for someone to
revive it and Murakami sure looks like a worthy contender. Just like Kafka,
Murakami succeeds in conjuring up a world where things are slightly off and
there's obvious doom awaiting the protagonist. But, Murakami takes it further
and gives it a post-modern touch by adding elements of metaphors, magic,
philosophy and self-references.</p>
<p>Kafka on the shore begins with a boy called Kafka packing his things and
preparing to run away from his home. He succeeds in reaching another place,
finding a place to live and thus evades the destiny that was awaiting him. Or
has he? He's living at a library with two peculiar characters - a transgender
man called Oshima and his(her?) loner boss called Miss Saeki. Meanwhile back in
Nakano (where Kafka runs away from), we're introduced to a mentally challenged
old man named Nakata who is gifted with the ability to talk to cats. The rest
of the story is all about how Kafka and Nakata's paths slowly but eventually
cross. A curse has been placed on Kafka by his father because of his mother's
sudden departure. Much as Kafka tries to avoid this curse, he seems to stumble
right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Fish raining from the sky, Johnnie Walker - the cat eater, Colonel Sanders - the
pimp, the philosophy grad hooker who talks Hegel, the ghost girl, the Entrance
Stone, the Edge of the World, the runaway soldiers. Sounds interesting, right?</p>
<p>If I had to condense the meaning I took from the book into one word, it would
be 'Acceptance'. Life is full of sadness - Miss Saeki's lover is brutally
murdered by a mob, Kafka's mother leaves without a word, Oshima is born woman
but lives as a man, Nakata had an accident which turns him into an Idiot; but
we shouldn't cling to these memories, we should put them behind and live - live
and enjoy. There's no point in worrying about the future as well - what's gonna
happen is gonna happen - like with Kafka, we can try and hide from fate, but we
can't avoid it. So we have to accept whatever comes our way, with a smile.</p>
<p>Life's shit, so what?</p>
<p>5/5 - excellent read, might change your perspective on life.</p>

<p>django-merchant is a Django app to accept payments from various payment
processors via Pluggable backends.</p>
<p>I'm glad to have the chance the contribute to merchant again; I was previously
involved in the design as well as eWay and bitcoin backends.</p>
<p>I have added a Continuous Integration build for merchant over at <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/agiliq/merchant">Travis</a></p>
<p>What's more, the <a class="reference external" href="http://merchant.agiliq.com">demo</a> is less of an eyesore now; it has been revamped using
bootstrap</p>
<p>We received contributions to Braintree, Google Checkout, and eWay backends
which I have reviewed and merged.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s been a really good month for django-merchant, here's to hoping
this continues.</p>

<h2>Whoosh</h2>
<p>While trying to work on django-haystack, I found a bug reported by Zed Shaw
where a search query would crash the search page provided by haystack.</p>
<p>Upon digging into haystack and whoosh, I found that there's a edge case in the
whoosh query parser where passing a query containg a stop word and negative
filter can raise an error (e.g: the query string <cite>?q=-1</cite>). I figured out a simple
fix and submitted a pull request which was promptly accepted.</p>
<p>I was hoping to find something to contribute to haystack and help with the
maintanance, but looks like it will have to wait untill I get some more time.</p>

<h2>django-browserid</h2>
<p>I have always been a fan of mozilla and django-browserid looks like the perfect
match for me to contribute towards. I tried out the library by going through
the docs and found it to be a breeze. I was able to improve the docs a bit and
triage a few bugs.</p>
<p>I have to say people working on this project are very helpful and
understanding. Looking forward to spending more time on this project in the
future.</p>

<p>I debugged an issue in django <cite>ModelChoiceField</cite> and <cite>ModelMultipleChoiceField</cite>
which was causing model forms to be validated even though they weren't changed.
The problem was that <cite>has_changed</cite> was comparing an <cite>object_id</cite> or list of
<cite>ids</cite> with an instance or queryset.</p>
<p>Even though the fix was a part of another branch, the tests I had proposed were

<h2>Merchant</h2>
<p>django-merchant is a Django app to accept payments from various payment
processors via Pluggable backends.</p>
<p>I'm glad to have the chance the contribute to merchant again; I was previously
involved in the design as well as eWay and bitcoin backends.</p>
<p>I have added a Continuous Integration build for merchant over at <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/agiliq/merchant">Travis</a></p>
<p>What's more, the <a class="reference external" href="http://merchant.agiliq.com">demo</a> is less of an eyesore now; it has been revamped using
bootstrap</p>
<p>We received contributions to Braintree, Google Checkout, and eWay backends
which I have reviewed and merged.</p>
<p>Overall, itâ€™s been a really good month for django-merchant, here's to hoping
this continues.</p>

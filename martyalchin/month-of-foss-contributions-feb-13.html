<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm documenting my contributions to FOSS every month from now for two purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a log of my activity</li>
<li>To serve as a motivation for further participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Psst, also for boasting about it, wink wink.</p>

<div class="section" id="whoosh">
<h2>Whoosh</h2>
<p>While trying to work on django-haystack, I found a bug reported by Zed Shaw
where a search query would crash the search page provided by haystack.</p>
<p>Upon digging into haystack and whoosh, I found that there's a edge case in the
whoosh query parser where passing a query containg a stop word and negative
filter can raise an error (e.g: the query string <cite>?q=-1</cite>). I figured out a simple
fix and submitted a pull request which was promptly accepted.</p>
<p>I was hoping to find something to contribute to haystack and help with the
maintanance, but looks like it will have to wait untill I get some more time.</p>

<h2>django-browserid</h2>
<p>I have always been a fan of mozilla and django-browserid looks like the perfect
match for me to contribute towards. I tried out the library by going through
the docs and found it to be a breeze. I was able to improve the docs a bit and
triage a few bugs.</p>
<p>I have to say people working on this project are very helpful and
understanding. Looking forward to spending more time on this project in the
future.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed working on these projects, and I'm looking forward to speding more time to get more
comfortable with them and contributing even more. Here's to bigger, better things!</p>

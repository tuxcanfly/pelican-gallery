We have to be all those difficult things like cheerful and kind and curious and

-- Chapter 37 The Botanic Garden, Amber Spyglass
</pre>
<p>It's been about a week since I've finished the last chapter of the series, and
I'm still absolutely floored at what a magnificent journey it has been and
still reeling from the emotional roller-coaster that the last chapters have
been. The series starts of with so many open mysteries and ends them all with
such grace that you can only wonder at it in awe. I'm glad that such a series
exists, that I came to know about it and had the extremely grateful opportunity
to read and enjoy it. I'm a mere mortal and I'm sure I can't do this series
justice by reviewing it, but I shall dare to try anyway.</p>
<p>His Dark Materials is an epic fantasy trilogy consisting of three books:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Northern Lights</li>
<li>The Subtle Knife</li>
<li>The Amber Spyglass</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="the-northern-lights">
<h3>The Northern Lights:</h3>
<p>The story is set in a parallel universe not unlike ours (although in the
beginning of the modern age), but with Dust, dæmons, the Alethiometer, witches,
angels and armoured bears. Lyra and her dæmon, Pantalaimon are off to a great
adventure to the North with the Gyptians where they'll need to rescue children
who have been kidnapped by the Gobblers. On her journey, Lyra encounters the
witches and armoured bears, seeking their help in her task. With courage,
cunning and the help of Iorek Byrnison the armoured bear, she takes on the evil
Gobblers. Towards the end, she has to choose between staying back or following
her father into another universe to seek closure for a friend she betrays
accidentally.</p>
<p>The action, adventure and mystery in this book make for a gripping narrative
will keep the reader hooked to solve the puzzle. A brief chat between the witch
Serafina Pekkala and the aeronaut Lee Scoresby contrasts the politics of both
sides. The exchange of words between Lyra and her father towards the end throws
light on the book's philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-subtle-knife">
<h3>The Subtle Knife:</h3>
<p>Finding herself in a strange new world (Cittàgazze), Lyra wanders and finds
another visitor, Will (from our current universe) and thus begins another
adventure to find Will's father, John Parry who is believed to have travelled
across to another universe. They enter Will's universe and find themselves in
trouble because the Alethiometer gets stolen by one of the members of the
Church and they have to find a certain &quot;Subtle Knife&quot; to get their Alethiometer
back. After a long fight with Knife's owner in Cittàgazze, they manage to get
hold of it and soon discover it's magic - it's a knife that can cut through the
very fabric of time and space to create a portal into another Universe! So, the
children use it and get back their stolen stuff with a clever plan. Lyra also
makes a new friend called Dr Mary Malone whose research into Dark Matter turns
out be similar to Dust. Meanwhile, Lyra's old friend Mr. Scoresby is assisting
Will's father find the children. Unfortunately, also looking for Will and Lyra
is a unit of the Church, headed by Mrs Coulter.</p>
<p>The second book introduces elements of science-fiction and builds on the
growing tension between the freethinkers headed by Lord Asriel and the Church.
There are a few heartbreaking moments when Lee Scoresby defends against the
Church's army and John Parry meets his son, Will.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-amber-spyglass">
<h3>The Amber Spyglass:</h3>
<p>We find that Mrs Coulter has kidnapped Lyra and many groups are looking for her
including Will and the armoured bears whom he befriends, Lord Asriel's army and
the Church's army. As is expected, there's a showdown between the three forces,
and the children manage to escape to another universe, Mrs Coulter is captured
by Lord Asriel's army. Meanwhile, Dr Mary Malone crosses into a strange
universe with small elephant-like creatures using wheels in addition to their
limbs. As the children go looking for the world of the dead, we find that the
Church has dispatched a hitman to kill Lyra to prevent a prophecy which would
end the Church's power. Mrs Coulter escapes to the Church, spies on them and
learns of another plan to assasinate Lyra. With the introduction of Metatron,
the Authority's commander, the fate of the battle between Lord Asriel and all
of the Church looms in the balance.</p>
<p>After an epic battle, we find the children with Dr Mary Malone who tempts them
into falling in love by telling them her story. What follows is an absolutely
amazing sequence recreating the traditional Adam and Eve story - the
temptation, the fall, the realization and acceptance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>There are lot of fantasy books and lots of beautiful poems, but in my opinion
none can match the breathtaking mix of fantasy and poetry that is His Dark
Materials. Yes, there are a few loose threads, but I think they are far too
minor to worry about. To crave for a 'happy lived together ever after' ending
is to miss the point of the book - there's no Paradise after all! If you want
one, create it yourself!</p>
